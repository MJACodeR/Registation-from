# REST API with MongoDB and Node.js

This project demonstrates the implementation of a RESTful API using MongoDB and Node.js. It includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and incorporates hashing and validation for secure data management.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory and providing the necessary configuration:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port in the `.env` file.

### API Endpoints

#### Create a New Item

- **Endpoint:** `/api/signup`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "email":'',
    "phone":"",
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Returns the created item.

#### Get All Items

- **Endpoint:** `/api/GetAllUser`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** Returns a list of all items.

#### Get an Item by ID

- **Endpoint:** `/api/emp/:_id`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** Returns the item with the specified ID.

#### Update an Item by ID

- **Endpoint:** `/api/Update/:_id`
- **Method:** PUT
- **Request Body:** Updated item data.
- **Response:** Returns the updated item.

#### Delete an Item by ID

- **Endpoint:** `/api/Delete/:_id`
- **Method:** DELETE
- **Response:** Returns a success message upon deletion.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Authorization is required for certain endpoints.

### Validation

- Input data is validated to ensure data integrity and security.

## Security

- Data is hashed before storage for added security.
